Subject: unification-fd Tutorial

Respected Sir,
The author replied 3 weeks ago. But it was not included in hackage description or on her website. Instead it was on,
http://community.haskell.org/~wren/unification-fd/test/tutorial/<http://community.haskell.org/~wren/unification-fd/test/>.

Anyways, so I am working on the tutorial document and the code that goes along with it.

Also I found some other attempt. I am not sure how relevant it is but any ways,

Furthermore, I need help with writing stuff down. I do no know how to proceed.

Thank you,
Mehul Solanki.
