Narrowing in Curry Programming Language.


This document has been written from various sources such as reports, manuals and research papers from the Curry programming language and implementing small working examples.


Functional Programming == Equational Definition of Functions
Logic Programming == First Order Predicate Logic

Therefore,
Functional Logic Programming == Equational Logic Programming (resolution + replacement of subterms)

{--
Constructor set C

Function / Operation set F

and some more math notations	
--}

Linear term = no multiple occurrences of one variable.

Operation(constructor) rooted term == root symbol is an operation
head normal form term == variable or constructor rooted term

A pattern is a term of the form f (d 1 , . . . , d n ) where f /n ∈ F and d 1 , . . . , d n ∈ T (C, X ). 

A term rewriting system (TRS) is set of rewrite rules, where an (uncon-ditional) rewrite rule is a pair l → r with a linear pattern l as the left-hand side
(lhs) and a term r as the right-hand side (rhs).
